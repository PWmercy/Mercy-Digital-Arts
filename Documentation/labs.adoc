Digiarts-Home-folders::

[.thumb]
.Home folders
image:media/homefolder.jpeg[image]

Within this shared drive you will find a private folder for each student. To find yours, look for your Mercy user name.

Within your personal folder, you will find a “My-Stuff” folder (See picture on right). Store _all_ school work inside this folder. It will be available throughout your stay in the major.

WARNING: The __My-Stuff__ folder is the ONLY area that is private to you. Anything that is left outside this folder is visible to anyone and could potentially be deleted.

MTEC-Classes (Music Production)::

CART-Classes (Design+Animation)::

[.thumb]
.Class folders
image:media/classfolders.jpeg[image]

In these shared drives, you should find a folder for each lab class. Choose the drive that matches your major. +

You should have access to the folder for each class in which you are enrolled. If you do not, please notify pwhite@mercy.edu right away. Indicate your Mercy Mavericks login name and the class that you are having a problem with.

_Within each class folder_, you will find additional folders. The use of these folders is up to each instructor.

*Pick-up-here*::
Your instructor may place assignments, media, test prep, etc.

*Drop-off-here*:: Your instructor may ask you to deposit homework, projects, etc. in here. Note that this folder is a "drop box" (not to be confused with _DropBox_ accounts). This means that you can drop files in but may not open the folder or see what’s inside. You will receive a warning to that effect when you drop a file. This is normal. +
+
If there is more than one section for a class (A, B, C), there will be a separate Drop-off-here folder for each section.

*Instructor-only*::
Private folder for the instructor. Not accessible to students.

*Collaboration*::
This is a folder that is open to all and may be used for group projects and collaboration with classmates or with your instructor.


=== Files in the Cloud

==== Microsoft OneDrive (and other cloud services)

Your Mercy account includes a free large (1TB) Microsoft OneDrive cloud drive. Log in on to OneDrive on the web with your user ID and password (or a OneDrive app on your personal Mac, PC, phone or tablet).

IMPORTANT: If you want access to files from anywhere outside the labs, get used to copying to your OneDrive before you leave a workstation.

// ==== ExpanDrive

// [.thumb]
// .Expandrive app
// image:media/expandriveapp.jpeg[image]
//
// This software allows OneDrive (or Google Drive or Dropbox) to appear on your computer desktop as if it were a thumb drive or portable hard drive. +
//
// It can be found in the Applications folder on your machine's hard drive (in Macintosh HD/Applications/ExpanDrive).
//
// . Run the program and choose OneDrive (you may also connect to DropBox, etc.).
// . Add your account and password to connect. Your account folder will show up on your computer desktop.
// // Add instructions to add shares after first run
//
//
// [TIP]
// When running, ExpanDrive shows a 5-petal flower in the upper right of the screen. +
