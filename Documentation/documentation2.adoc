=== License servers

==== Local

** Ableton Live
*** We use Sassafras KeyServer, part of https://www.sassafras.com/solutions/#features[Sassafras AllSight]
*** Sassafras server currently runs on Mini-Server2 (vh216mc11531srv02 at 172.31.48.93)
**** The license for Sassafras itself is placed in
     /Library/KeyServer/KeyServer Data Folder and must be named _**server.lic**_

**** The license for Ableton Live is also placed in this folder. It is named similar to _3452175_sstauff@mercy.edu_11_Suite_25.lic_
+
IMPORTANT: Check permissions of these files if there are issues
+
**** A custom install pkg for Sassafras (separate from Ableton setup) can be created from their installation download.
    See https://gist.github.com/PWmercy/f3a6ebe6fdc115c92b8e6d3555d76442[gist here] (Requires log in to GitHub)

** Pro Tools
*** iLok License Manager app runs a
    https://help.ilok.com/server_configure_server.html[license server] on Mac mini
    server (cata-license3.mercy.local - formerly server6.digiarts.mercy - or vh216mc28394srv06).
**** Requires iLok dongle plugged into server. Currently using 2nd Gen iLok named "Network" (Ser# 00150556)
**** Using Apple Remote Desktop or Screen Sharing, connect to vh216mc28394srv06.
**** Run iLok License Manager and choose Preferences menu item.
**** Choose Server Admin and make sure it is ON

*** Same iLok License Manager app runs on all MPRA lab Macs (no server).
**** Although lab clients are set to automatically discover the license server, a video of manual connection steps is
     https://munki6.digiarts.mercy:8090/Video_Help/Connect_to_Pro_Tools_license_1.mp4[here] (only available on campus wired network).

NOTE: The steps above do _not_ require you to log in to iLok account.
