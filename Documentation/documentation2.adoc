  *** One is "Active" the other "Passive". Synchronization is continuous via a direct-connect ethernet "heartbeat" interface.
  *** If active device fails, the passive device takes over and service availabilty is restored within minutes.
 ** Backups

   **** Uses Synology Hyper Backup
  *** Folder Sync
   **** Uses built-in "Shared Folder Sync" in Control Panel
   **** Live mirror of Class Folders
