Installing and Updating Software

// tag::install_update[]

=====
Some software can be installed or updated by students or faculty _without_ needing special permission (administrator privileges).
=====

* Installation and updates are managed centrally by the Technology Manager. This allows time for testing and helps ensure consistency, security, compatibility, and license compliance.

** If you try to install or update most software on lab computers, you will be asked for an administrator password. Standard user accounts are not permitted to update or install software in this way.

** As a rule software is automatically updated after it has been tested, so there should be few occasions when you need to use the alternatives below.

There are three methods where you may be able to do your own installation or update, depending on the software.

*Adobe Creative Cloud* image:media/AdobeCC_app_icon.png[AdobeCC app, 10%]::

The Adobe Creative Cloud applications include Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere Pro, etc.

* Students and faculty may install and update these applications as needed using the Adobe Creative Cloud app, found in the Applications folder in Adobe Creative Cloud folder.
** This is the same app used to log in to your Adobe account.
** If you are already logged in, there should be an icon in the menu bar, at the top right of the screen.

*Self-Service app* image:media/maverick_icon_sm.png[Self-Service, 10%]::

* Located in the Dock at the bottom of the Mac desktop, this app can also be found in the Applications folder. It has an Mercy Mavericks icon.
** In general, this app will present you with standard or optional App Store apps that have previously been approved.

NOTE: Ignore the login option. You do _not_ need to log in to this app.

*Managed Software Center app* image:media/managed_software_center.png[Managed Software Center, 10%]::
