*** Two identical Synology devices act in tandem. They are each independently connected to the network switch, but share a single IP address (Primary cluster interface).
*** One is "Active" the other "Passive". Synchronization is continuous via a direct-connect ethernet "heartbeat" interface.
*** If active device fails, the passive device takes over and service availability is restored within minutes.
