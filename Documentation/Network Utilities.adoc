The original author seems to be Charles Edge, here's the [original

as pointed out by @percisely.


**Note**: Since this seems to be helpful to some people, I formatted it to
improve readability of the
[original](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jjnilton/add1eeeb3a9616f53e4c/raw/d7561c2ad6ab2b15aa85dafb9613c3c338e7583e/mac%2520network%2520commands%2520terminal).
Also, note that this is from 2016, many things may have changed, and I don't
use macOS anymore, so I probably can't help in case of questions, but maybe
someone else can.

# Mac Network Commands Cheat Sheet

> After writing up the presentation for MacSysAdmin in Sweden, I decided to
go ahead and throw these into a quick cheat sheet for anyone who’d like to
have them all in one place.
Good luck out there, and stay salty.

Get an ip address for en0:

```
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

Same thing, but setting and echoing a variable:

```
ip=`ipconfig getifaddr en0` ; echo $ip
```

View the subnet mask of en0:

```
ipconfig getoption en0 subnet_mask
```

View the dns server for en0:

```
ipconfig getoption en0 domain_name_server
```

Get information about how en0 got its DHCP on:

```
ipconfig getpacket en1
```

View some network info:

```
ifconfig en0
```

Set en0 to have an IP address of 10.10.10.10 and a subnet mask of
255.255.255.0:

```
ifconfig en0 inet 10.10.10.10 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

Show a list of locations on the computer:

```
networksetup -listlocations
```

Obtain the active location the system is using:

```
networksetup -getcurrentlocation
```

Create a network location called Work and populate it with information from
the active network connection:

```
networksetup -createlocation Work populate
```

Delete a network location called Work:

```
networksetup -deletelocation Work
```

Switch the active location to a location called Work:

```
networksetup -switchlocation Work
```

Switch the active location to a location called Work, but also show the GUID
of that location so we can make scripties with it laters:

```
scselect Work
```

List all of the network interfaces on the system:

```
networksetup -listallnetworkservices
```

Rename the network service called Ethernet to the word Wired:

```
networksetup -renamenetworkservice Ethernet Wired
```

Disable a network interface:

```
networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled off
```

Change the order of your network services:

```
networksetup -ordernetworkservices “Wi-Fi” “USB Ethernet”
```

Set the interface called Wi-Fi to obtain it if it isn’t already:

```
networksetup -setdhcp Wi-Fi
```

Renew DHCP leases:

```
ipconfig set en1 BOOTP && ipconfig set en1 DHCP
ifconfig en1 down && ifconfig en1 up
```

Renew a dhcp lease in a script:

```
echo "add State:/Network/Interface/en0/RefreshConfiguration temporary" | sudo scutil
```

Configure a manual static IP address:

```
networksetup -setmanual Wi-Fi 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1
```

Configure the dns servers for a given network interface:

```
networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.3
```

Obtain the dns servers used on the Wi-Fi interface:

```
networksetup -getdnsservers Wi-Fi
```

Stop the application layer firewall:

```
launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.alf.useragent.plistlaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.alf.agent.plist
```

Start the application layer firewall:

```
launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.alf.agent.plistlaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.alf.useragent.plist
```

Allow an app to communicate outside the system through the application layer
firewall:

```
socketfilterfw -t“/Applications/FileMaker Pro/FileMaker Pro.app/Contents/MacOS/FileMaker Pro”
```

See the routing table of a Mac:

```
netstat -nr
```

Add a route so that traffic for 10.0.0.0/32 communicates over the 10.0.9.2
network interface:

```
route -n add 10.0.0.0/32 10.0.9.2
```
Log bonjour traffic at the packet level:

```
sudo killall -USR2 mDNSResponder
```

Stop Bonjour:

```
launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist
```

Start Bonjour:

```
launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist
```

Put a delay in your pings:

```
ping -i 5 192.168.210.1
```

Ping the hostname 5 times and then stop the ping:

```
ping -c 5 google.com
```

Flood ping the host:

```
ping -f localhost
```

Set the packet size during your ping:

```
ping -s 100 google.com
```

Customize the source IP during your ping:

```
ping -S 10.10.10.11 google.com
```

View disk performance:

```
iostat -d disk0
```

Get information about the airport connection on your system:

```
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport -I
```

Scan the available Wireless networks:

```
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport -s
```

Trace the path packets go through:

```
traceroute google.com
```

Trace the routes without looking up names:

```
traceroute -n google.com
```

Trace a route in debug mode:

```
traceroute -d google.com
```

View information on all sockets:

```
netstat -at
```

View network information for IPv6:

```
netstat -lt
```

View per protocol network statistics:

```
netstat -s
```

View the statistics for a specific network protocol:

```
netstat -p igmp
```

Show statistics for network interfaces:

```
netstat -i
```

View network information as it happens (requires ntop to be installed):

```
ntop
```

Scan port 80 of www.google.com

```
/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Network\ Utility.app/Contents/Resources/stroke www.google.com 80 80
```

Port scan krypted.com stealthily:

```
nmap -sS -O krypted.com/24
```

Establish a network connection with www.apple.com:

```
nc -v www.apple.com 80
```

Establish a network connection with gateway.push.apple.com over port 2195:

```
/usr/bin/nc -v -w 15 gateway.push.apple.com 2195
```

Establish a network connection with feedback.push.apple.com only allowing
IPv4:

```
/usr/bin/nc -v -4 feedback.push.apple.com 2196
```

Setup a network listener on port 2196 for testing:

```
/usr/bin/nc -l 2196
```

Capture some packets:

```
tcpdump -nS
```

Capture all the packets:

```
tcpdump -nnvvXS
```

Capture the packets for a given port:

```
tcpdump -nnvvXs 548
```

Capture all the packets for a given port going to a given destination of
10.0.0.48:

```
tcpdump -nnvvXs 548 dst 10.0.0.48
```

Capture the packets as above but dump to a pcap file:

```
tcpdump -nnvvXs 548 dst 10.0.0.48 -w /tmp/myfile.pcap
```

Read tcpdump (cap) files and try to make them human readable:

```
tcpdump -qns 0 -A -r /var/tmp/capture.pcap
```

What binaries have what ports and in what states are those ports:

```
lsof -n -i4TCP
```

Make an alias for looking at what has a listener open, called ports:

```
alias ports='lsof -n -i4TCP | grep LISTEN'
```

Report back the name of the system:

```
hostname
```

Flush the dns cache:

```
dscacheutil -flushcache
```

Clear your arp cache:

```
arp -ad
```

View how the Server app interprets your network settings:

```
serveradmin settings network
```

Whitelist the IP address 10.10.10.2:

```
/Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/libexec/afctl -w 10.10.10.2
```
